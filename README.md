## Install
```shell
npm i --save react-native-safari-view
```

## Usage
### Linking the Library
In order to use Safari View, you must first link the library your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).

### Displaying the Safari View
Once you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:

```js
var SafariView = require('react-native-safari-view');
```

Displaying the Safari View is as simple as calling:
```js
SafariView.show({
  url: 'https://github.com/naoufal'
});
```

## Example
Using Safari View in your app will usually look like this:
```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import SafariView from "react-native-safari-view";

class YourComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  _pressHandler() {
    SafariView.isAvailable()
      .then(SafariView.show({
        url: "https://github.com/naoufal"
      }))
      .catch(error => {
        // Fallback WebView code for iOS 8 and earlier
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        ...
        <Button onPress={this._pressHandler}>
          Show Safari View
        </Button>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
